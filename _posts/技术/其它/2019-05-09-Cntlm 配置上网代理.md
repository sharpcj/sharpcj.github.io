下载安装 Cntlm 之后。仅仅须要改动 `cntlm.ini` 文件，提供身份认证必要的信息，然后以服务的方式启动 cntlm 就能够了。
在 `cntlm.ini` 中有例如以下几个重要的配置是可能须要改动的：

```
Username - your domain/proxy account name

Domain - the actual domain name

Workstation - NetBIOS name of your workstation; Cntlm tries to autodetect it, but you might want to set it explicitly should dialect detection fail (see below)

Proxy - IP address (or ping-able hostname) of your proxy; if you use several alternative proxies or know of backup ones, use this option multiple times; if one stops working, Cntlm will move on to the next

Listen - local port number which Cntlm should bind to; the default is OK, but remember you can't have more than one application per port; you can use netstat to list used up ports (lines with LISTEN)
```
